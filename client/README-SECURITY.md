# FinanceTrack Security Implementation

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the FinanceTrack application, focusing on network security and data protection.

## TLS 1.3 and Certificate Pinning

The application implements TLS 1.3 for all API communications with certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

### Certificate Pinning

Certificate pinning is implemented using the `react-native-ssl-pinning` library. This ensures that the app only communicates with servers that have the expected certificate.

To update the certificate hashes:

1. Obtain the certificate fingerprints from your API servers
2. Update the `TRUSTED_CERTIFICATES` object in `services/secureNetwork.ts`
3. Include backup certificates to prevent app failure during certificate rotation

### Implementation Details

- All network requests use the secure networking layer (`secureNetwork.ts`)
- Certificate validation occurs for both development and production environments
- The app enforces TLS 1.3 via headers when supported by the server

## Secure Communication with Third-Party Services

### Plaid Integration

The Plaid API integration has been secured with:

- HTTPS for all API calls
- Proper authentication token handling
- Certificate pinning for Plaid API endpoints

## Server Configuration Requirements

To fully implement TLS 1.3 and certificate pinning, the backend server must be configured with:

1. TLS 1.3 support
2. Valid SSL certificates (not self-signed for production)
3. Proper CORS configuration

## Testing Certificate Pinning

To verify certificate pinning is working correctly:

1. Run the app in development mode
2. Check console logs for "[Secure] Making request..." messages
3. Use a proxy tool like Charles Proxy to attempt MITM attacks (should fail)

## Production Considerations

Before deploying to production:

1. Replace placeholder certificate hashes with actual values
2. Implement a certificate rotation strategy
3. Test thoroughly with production endpoints
4. Consider implementing certificate transparency verification

## Additional Security Measures

The application also implements:

- Secure token storage
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
- Proper session management
